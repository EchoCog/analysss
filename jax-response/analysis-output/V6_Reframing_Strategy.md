# Affidavit v6 - Strength and Capability Reframing

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Purpose:** Reframe affidavit from defensive/victim narrative to assertive/competent director narrative

---

## Key Strategic Shifts

### 1. From Defense to Offense
- **NOT:** "We didn't do wrong"
- **BUT:** "We built this business and the Applicant disrupts our success"

### 2. From Victim to Authority
- **NOT:** "We were excluded"
- **BUT:** "The Applicant improperly interferes with our director authorities"

### 3. From Personal to Corporate
- **NOT:** "This harms us"
- **BUT:** "This disrupts business operations and harms corporate interests"

---

## Language Changes Applied

### Weak Passive Language â†’ Strong Active Language

| Weak (Removed) | Strong (Added) |
|----------------|----------------|
| "prevented from" | "The Applicant improperly restricts my ability to" |
| "unable to perform" | "The Applicant interferes with my performance of" |
| "cannot perform" | "The Applicant obstructs my performance of" |
| "restricted from" | "The Applicant improperly restricts" |
| "we are unable" | "The Applicant improperly restricts our ability" |

## New Sections Added

### 1. Enhanced Responsible Person Section
- Emphasizes expertise and successful track record
- Frames as "internationally recognized" authority
- Demands restoration of access (not requests)
- Highlights business value created

### 2. Director Competence and Business Success Section (NEW)
- Establishes First and Second Respondents as competent business leaders
- Lists concrete achievements under their leadership
- Highlights Second Respondent's crisis management success (Chesno fraud recovery)
- Emphasizes specialized expertise essential to operations
- Demands removal of obstructions (not protection)

### 3. Enhanced Prayer/Conclusion
- "Restoration of Director Authorities" framing
- Emphasizes competence and track record
- Seeks removal of improper obstructions
- Positions as rightful authorities temporarily obstructed

---

## Specific Section Enhancements

### Responsible Person Role
**BEFORE:** Suggests inability to function  
**AFTER:** 
- "Successfully maintained regulatory compliance for [X] years"
- "Internationally recognized Responsible Person"
- "I demand immediate restoration of access"

### IT Expenses
**BEFORE:** Defensive about documentation  
**AFTER:**
- "Daniel systematically provided all accessible documentation"
- "Maintained operations despite Applicant's disruptive actions"
- "Second Respondent's expertise essential to international expansion"

### Director Loans
**BEFORE:** Defending the payment  
**AFTER:**
- "Exercised standard drawing rights"
- "Routine director account management"
- "Consistent with [X] years of practice"

### Business Operations
**BEFORE:** Suggests breakdown/dysfunction  
**AFTER:**
- "Applicant excludes competent directors who built this business"
- "Successfully expanded to 37 jurisdictions"
- "Applicant's restrictions interfere with effective management"

---

## Criminal Matter Framing

**NOT:** "We are victims of crime"  
**BUT:** "We are pursuing accountability for corporate malfeasance"

**Language:**
- "We have reported criminal conduct to appropriate authorities"
- "The fraudulent basis of this interdict has been exposed"
- "We are taking decisive action against those who betrayed corporate interests"

---

## Bottom Line Narrative

**The revised narrative:**

> Competent directors who built a successful international business demand removal of improper restrictions imposed through a fraudulently obtained interdict. The Applicant's actions disrupt operations, violate governance principles, and harm corporate interests. The First and Second Respondents seek restoration of their rightful authorities to continue building value for all stakeholders.

This positions Jax and Daniel as:
- Strong business leaders
- Temporarily obstructed by improper legal maneuvering
- Demanding restoration of rightful authorities
- NOT as victims needing court protection
