# New Sections for v6 Integration

## Section 1: Enhanced Responsible Person


üü¢ **ENHANCED: Responsible Person Authority and Expertise**

**[X.1]** I serve as the internationally recognized Responsible Person for RegimA products in 37 jurisdictions under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent international laws. I have successfully maintained RegimA's regulatory compliance in these jurisdictions for [X] years without incident, violation, or regulatory sanction.

**[X.2]** This role requires specialized expertise in:
- International cosmetics regulatory frameworks
- Product safety assessment and documentation
- Market surveillance and adverse event reporting
- Regulatory authority liaison and compliance management

**[X.3]** My successful execution of these responsibilities has enabled RegimA's international expansion and market access across 37 jurisdictions, generating substantial revenue and establishing the company's reputation for regulatory excellence.

**[X.4]** The Applicant's interdict inappropriately restricts my execution of critical regulatory functions that are non-delegable by law. I demand immediate restoration of access to perform my legal duties, as any interruption creates regulatory non-compliance, exposes the companies to substantial penalties, and jeopardizes market access.
