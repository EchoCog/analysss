# Affidavit Version 6 - Changes Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Version:** v6 (REVISED_Answering_Affidavit_Jax_TRACKED_CHANGES_v6.md)  
**Major Change:** Complete reframing from defensive/victim narrative to assertive/competent director narrative

---

## Strategic Transformation: From Defense to Offense

### Core Narrative Shift

**v5 Narrative (Defensive):**
- "We didn't do anything wrong"
- "We were excluded and prevented from performing duties"
- "We need protection from Peter's actions"
- Victim positioning

**v6 Narrative (Offensive):**
- "We built this successful international business"
- "The Applicant improperly interferes with our director authorities"
- "We demand restoration of our rightful authorities"
- Authority positioning

---

## Language Reframing: Weak → Strong

### Systematic Language Changes

| Weak Passive Language (v5) | Strong Active Language (v6) |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| "prevented from" | "The Applicant improperly restricts my ability to" |
| "unable to perform" | "The Applicant interferes with my performance of" |
| "cannot perform" | "The Applicant obstructs my performance of" |
| "restricted from" | "The Applicant improperly restricts" |
| "we are unable" | "The Applicant improperly restricts our ability" |
| "this prevents me/us" | "The Applicant's conduct improperly prevents" |

**Strategic Impact:**
- Shifts agency from passive victims to active directors
- Identifies Applicant as source of improper conduct
- Frames restrictions as improper interference, not legitimate oversight

## Strategic Impact

### 1. Credibility Enhancement

**v5:** Defensive posture can suggest guilt or weakness  
**v6:** Assertive posture suggests confidence and legitimacy

### 2. Judicial Perception

**v5:** Court sees parties needing protection  
**v6:** Court sees competent directors improperly obstructed

### 3. Burden of Proof

**v5:** Respondents must prove they didn't do wrong  
**v6:** Applicant must justify interfering with successful directors

### 4. Remedy Framing

**v5:** "Please protect us from Peter"  
**v6:** "Remove Peter's improper obstructions of our rightful authorities"

---

## Bottom Line Narrative (v6)

> **Competent directors who built a successful international business across 37 jurisdictions demand removal of improper restrictions imposed through a fraudulently obtained interdict. The Applicant manufactured a crisis, bypassed his absolute trust powers, misled this court through six material non-disclosures, and now obstructs directors who have demonstrated exceptional competence through years of successful management. The First and Second Respondents seek restoration of their rightful authorities to continue building value for all stakeholders and to fulfill their legal and fiduciary duties without improper interference.**

This positions Jax and Daniel as:
- **Strong business leaders** with proven track record
- **Temporarily obstructed** by improper legal maneuvering
- **Demanding restoration** of rightful authorities
- **NOT victims** needing court protection
