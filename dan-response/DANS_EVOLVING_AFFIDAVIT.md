1.1.5 I have personal and direct knowledge of all facts deposed to in this affidavit, having been present for all events described or having directly managed the systems and operations referenced.

### 1.2 Purpose of This Affidavit

1.2.1 This affidavit serves as my witness statement regarding the systematic criminal enterprise conducted by the First and Second Respondents to appropriate businesses I built independently after they forcibly ejected me from their premises in 2016.

1.2.2 I depose to the facts supporting Jacqueline Faucitt's answering affidavit in her defense against the Respondents' fraudulent interdict application.

1.2.3 **Critical Context**: This case involves the attempted theft of businesses worth R 250,000,000+ that I built independently over 8 years (2016-2025) after being forcibly ejected and told "you're on your own."

---

## 2. THE 2016 FORCED SEPARATION: FOUNDATIONAL CONTEXT

### 2.1 The Ejection Incident (2016)

2.1.1 **Background Disagreement**: In 2016, I advocated for technology-driven business advancement and digital transformation initiatives, while the First Respondent argued that such technological investment was too expensive and unnecessary.

2.1.2 **The Ejection**: Following this fundamental disagreement over technology strategy, the First Respondent:
- Physically ejected Kay Pretorius and myself from the office premises
- Instructed staff to disregard any instructions from me
- Confiscated my equipment (computers, laptops, business tools)
- Declared: **"You're on your own now"**
- Forced self-funding: **"Buy your own laptops, pay for your own office"**

2.1.3 **Legal Effect**: This was not a voluntary separation but forcible ejection followed by systematic exclusion from existing business operations.

2.1.4 **Witnesses**: Multiple staff members received the First Respondent's instructions to disregard my authority.

### 2.2 Independent Business Building (2016-2019)

2.2.1 **Forced Independence**: With no choice after the ejection, Kay and I were forced to build independent operations from my residential property.

2.2.2 **Personal Investment**: I invested my own resources in:
- Home office infrastructure (dedicated space, business-grade internet)
- Equipment (laptops, servers, networking equipment)
- Software subscriptions (Shopify, QuickBooks, development tools)
- Utilities and operational costs

2.2.3 **Technical Development**: Between 2016-2019, I built from scratch:
- 51 Shopify stores across multiple entities
- 18 QuickBooks accounting systems (South African and UK)
- Multi-store architecture with regional segmentation
- Development infrastructure (36 development stores)
- Technical expertise leading to Shopify Plus enterprise qualification

2.2.4 **By July 26, 2017, our operations had achieved Shopify Plus enterprise status**, requiring minimum annual revenue of approximately R 13,000,000.

2.2.5 Attached hereto marked **"Annexure DF1"** is a copy of the July 26, 2017 email correspondence with Richard Estabrooks, Shopify Plus Launch Manager, confirming our Shopify Plus onboarding.

### 2.3 The First Respondent's "You're On Your Own" Declaration

2.3.1 **Explicit Severance**: The First Respondent's 2016 statement "You're on your own now, buy your own laptops, pay for your own office" constituted explicit severance of any business relationship.

2.3.2 **Legal Waiver**: This declaration legally waived any future claims the First Respondent might have to businesses I would build independently.

2.3.3 **Estoppel Effect**: The First Respondent cannot now claim ownership of businesses he explicitly told me to build independently.

## 4. THE JULY 26, 2017 SHOPIFY PLUS ACHIEVEMENT

### 4.1 Shopify Plus Qualification

4.1.1 **Date**: July 26, 2017 (approximately 1 year after forced separation)

4.1.2 **Participants in Meeting**:
- Kay Pretorius (KAYP@RZO.IO) - Primary contact
- Myself (CC'd on all correspondence)
- Richard Estabrooks (Shopify Plus Launch Manager)

4.1.3 **Shopify Plus Requirements** (2017):
- Minimum $1M USD annual revenue (approximately R 13M ZAR)
- Established business operations (not startups)
- Technical sophistication (API integrations, multi-store management)
- Growth trajectory and scaling capability

4.1.4 **Qualification Significance**: Within **1 year** of the First Respondent's forced ejection, Kay and I had built operations generating **R 13M+ annually** - completely independently.

### 4.2 What Shopify Plus Proves

4.2.1 **Independent Capability**: The qualification demonstrates that Kay and I possessed the technical expertise and business acumen to build substantial operations without the First Respondent's involvement.

4.2.2 **Complete Independence**: All revenue, operations, and technical infrastructure were built using our own resources after the First Respondent told us "you're on your own."

4.2.3 **Demolishes False Claims**: The Shopify Plus qualification within 1 year of ejection proves:

## 5. POST-LOCKDOWN EXPANSION (2020-2021)

### 5.1 Market Opportunity

5.1.1 **Distributor Collapse**: During COVID-19 lockdown (2020-2021), four major distributors ceased operations, creating significant market gaps.

5.1.2 **Strategic Response**: I identified this opportunity and expanded Shopify operations to capture market share from failed distributors.

5.1.3 **Technical Implementation**: I created additional Shopify stores and systems to handle:
- Different distributor territories and customer bases
- Regional pricing and inventory management
- Separate sales rep assignments
- Business continuity and risk distribution

### 5.2 The Four Shopify Systems Architecture

5.2.1 **System Segregation**: The multiple Shopify systems were not "excessive IT expenses" as falsely claimed by the Respondents, but sophisticated business architecture designed for:
- Territory separation (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KZN, Gauteng)
- Customer base segmentation (former distributor customers)
- Risk distribution across multiple platforms
- Development and testing environments

5.2.2 **Total Combined Revenue**: R 34,900,000+ annually across all systems by 2023-2025

## 6. THE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE (2025)

### 6.1 The May 22, 2025 Shopify Audit Trail Destruction

6.1.1 **What Happened**: On May 22, 2025, the Respondents systematically destroyed the Shopify audit trail showing my 8 years of operational control (2017-2025).

6.1.2 **Evidence Destroyed**: The audit trail that would have shown:
- My exclusive administrative access and control
- All configuration changes and system modifications
- Payment processing setups and modifications
- Store creation and management activities
- Integration configurations with QuickBooks and other systems

6.1.3 **Criminal Intent**: This destruction was deliberate and systematic, designed to eliminate evidence of my independent business building and operational control.

6.1.4 **Timing Significance**: This occurred during the period when the Respondents were planning their fraudulent appropriation scheme.

### 6.2 The June 7, 2025 Payment Card Cancellation

6.2.1 **Systematic Sabotage**: On June 7, 2025, the Respondents cancelled all payment cards associated with the Shopify operations, causing immediate business disruption.

6.2.2 **Financial Impact**: This action:
- Disrupted ongoing business operations
- Caused loss of customer confidence
- Interfered with supplier payments
- Created artificial cash flow crisis

6.2.3 **Coordination with Other Actions**: This card cancellation was coordinated with:
- The May 22 audit trail destruction
- Preparation for the fraudulent interdict application
- Systematic exclusion from business operations

### 6.3 The Pattern of Criminal Conduct

6.3.1 **2016**: Forced separation ("you're on your own")
6.3.2 **2016-2019**: Independent business building (R 2M → R 34.9M)
6.3.3 **2017**: Shopify Plus qualification proving independence
6.3.4 **2020-2021**: Strategic expansion capturing distributor market share

### 7.3 Emotional and Personal Impact
