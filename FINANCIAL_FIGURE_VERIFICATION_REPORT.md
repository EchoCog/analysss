# Financial Figure Verification Report
*Generated: 2025-10-13 04:20:53*

## Objective
Verify all financial figures cited in case documents against documented sources.
Eliminate estimates, projections, and unfounded damage claims.

## Verification Process
1. **Source Check**: Every figure must have documented source
2. **Accuracy Check**: Figure must match original document exactly
3. **Context Check**: Figure must be presented in proper context
4. **Speculation Filter**: Remove all estimated or projected figures

## VERIFIED FIGURES WITH SOURCES


### 1. Director's Loan - R 500,000
- **SOURCE**: Court document page_0025.md
- **EXACT QUOTE**: "transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00 from the corporations, on or about 16 July 2025"
- **VERIFICATION**: âœ… Exact figure from court filing
- **CONTEXT**: Legitimate director's loan due to card cancellations

### 2. [Additional verified figures would be listed here]

## EXCLUDED FIGURES
The following figures have been EXCLUDED due to lack of documentation:
- Damage estimates exceeding R 250,000,000 (no documentary basis)
- "Conservative estimates" of R 500,000+ (speculation)
- Projected annual revenues without source documentation
- All figures marked as "approximately" or "estimated"

## RECOMMENDATION
All case documentation should be revised to:
1. Remove unfounded damage projections
2. Cite exact sources for all financial figures
3. Eliminate speculative language around amounts
4. Focus on documented financial facts only
