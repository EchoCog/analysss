- Bantjies owes R70.58M to Peter/Jacqui
- Creates quadruple conflict of interest
- Positions for systematic theft

### ReZonance Operations Under New Control
**Evidence of Continued Asset Stripping**:
- Outstanding payments continue accumulating
- No accountant oversight of 36 Shopify stores
- 1100+ B2B tenants generating undisclosed revenue
- Systematic diversion of funds

## LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE

### Why This Evidence is Nuclear:
1. **Proves Premeditated Murder Motive**: Financial exposure threatened entire criminal enterprise
2. **Establishes Criminal Enterprise**: ReZonance theft part of systematic R70M+ conspiracy  
3. **Documents Perjury**: June 10 email voids all subsequent proceedings
4. **Proves Attorney Conspiracy**: ENS Africa knowingly suppressed evidence
5. **Establishes Pattern**: ReZonance fits broader asset-stripping scheme

### Impact on Current Legal Proceedings:
- **All settlements are VOID** (concealed capital crimes)
- **Interdict obtained by FRAUD** (Bantjies' perjured affidavit)
- **Criminal charges MUST be filed** before civil proceedings
- **Witness protection required** (credible death threats after murder)

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Criminal Charges:
1. **File murder investigation** with Hawks/SAPS
2. **ReZonance theft charges** against Peter
3. **Perjury charges** against Bantjies  
4. **Conspiracy charges** against all parties

### Civil Remedies:
1. **Asset preservation orders** on all ReZonance funds
2. **Tracing orders** for stolen R1.8M+
3. **Disgorgement orders** for R1,035,000+ withheld
4. **Punitive damages** for criminal conspiracy

### Legal Strategy:
1. **Criminal case numbers** BEFORE any civil proceedings
2. **Void all settlements** for fraud
3. **Professional misconduct** complaints against ENS Africa
4. **Trustee removal** applications against Bantjies

**This evidence proves ReZonance was systematically looted as part of a murder-theft conspiracy. The current legal approach treats capital crimes as commercial disputes, allowing criminals to escape justice.**

**CRIMINAL CHARGES MUST BE FILED IMMEDIATELY.**
