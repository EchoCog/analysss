## Key Content

### Version 3 (Current)
**Critical Corrections:**
- **Paragraph 48:** Clarified Gauteng Family Law Forum was NOT in original draft
- **Evidence of manipulation:** Duplicate "bear costs" clauses prove hasty copy-paste
- **Paragraph 129:** Isaac Chesno fraud (£500K+), Daniel's 8-year restoration

### Strategic Framework
1. Material Non-Disclosure - Peter obtained interdict through fraud
2. Peter's Inconsistency - Weaponizing practices he accepted for years
3. Peter Created Problems - Card cancellations, system lockouts, Rynette empowerment
4. Timing Reveals Motive - Settlement → 2 days → interdict → 9 months → payout
5. Pattern of Misrepresentation - Settlement, R500K, IT expenses, Chesno fraud
6. Daniel's Competence - 8 years rescuing £500K+ fraud-damaged company
7. Regulatory Crisis - Immediate non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions

### Evidence Requirements
- Responsible Person documentation (37 jurisdictions)
- Director loan account statements
- JF5 draft and final agreements
- Daniel's witness statement ("Has anything changed?")
- UK tax residency documentation
- Chesno fraud documentation
- Daniel's 8-year restoration evidence
