## THE QUADRUPLE CONFLICT EXPOSED

### Bantjies' Four Simultaneous Criminal Positions

**1. DEBTOR** 
- Owes R70,580,000 to Peter/Jacqui through investment company
- Creates massive financial incentive to manipulate trust

**2. TRUSTEE**
- Controls Faucitt Family Trust receiving same R70,580,000
- Has fiduciary duty to protect ALL beneficiaries (including his creditors)

**3. COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**  
- Statutory authority equivalent to magistrate
- Used position to legitimize fraudulent affidavits

**4. CONSPIRATOR/WITNESS**
- Received murder/fraud evidence June 2025
- Concealed evidence and gave false supporting testimony

### Criminal Timeline Proving Premeditation

| Date | Event | Criminal Significance |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **June 2025** | Receives murder/fraud evidence | Chooses crime over duty |

| **August 2025** | False supporting testimony | Perjury and conspiracy |

## CRITICAL EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS

### From Section 21 (Quadruple Conflict)
> "The Four Conflicting Roles create a situation where Bantjies cannot possibly act in the best interests of beneficiaries. Every decision he makes as Trustee directly affects his R70.58M debt position."

### Strategic Positioning Proof
> "Bantjies was appointed trustee in July 2024, exactly 22 months before the May 2026 payout of R18.685M. This timing cannot be coincidental."

### Commissioner Abuse Evidence  
> "As Commissioner of Oaths, Bantjies holds statutory authority similar to a magistrate. His abuse of this position for R70.58M personal benefit constitutes corruption of the highest order."
