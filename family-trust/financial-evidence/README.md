**⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION**: Previous analysis incorrectly summed option prices (R18.685M + R23.165M + R28.730M = R70.58M). **CORRECT**: These are escalating option prices - only ONE payment will be made, most likely R18.685M in May 2026.

**Purpose**: Documentary evidence of R18.685M investment **option** and Danie Bantjies' financial conflicts of interest  
**Evidence Type**: Financial analysis and investment documentation

## FINANCIAL CRIME BREAKDOWN

### THE R18.685 MILLION INVESTMENT OPTION (CORRECTED INTERPRETATION)

**Three-Year Staged Payouts**:

| **Payment Date** | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Jacqui's Share (~50%)** |
|------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **May 2026** | R18,685,000 | R3,737 | ~R9,342,500 |
| **May 2027** | R23,165,000 | R4,633 | ~R11,582,500 |
| **May 2029** | R28,730,000 | R5,746 | ~R14,365,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **R18,685,000 (option price)** | - | **~R9,342,500** |

### CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY MOTIVE

**Why Bantjies Positioned Himself as Trustee (July 2024)**:

1. **Personal Debt**: Owes R10M+ to Peter/Jacqui personally
2. **Investment Control**: As trustee, controls R18.685M+ payout distribution  
3. **Timeline**: Appointed 22 months before first R18.685M payout (May 2026)
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Can manipulate distributions to benefit his debtors over other beneficiaries

**The Perfect Crime Structure**:
- Bantjies owes money to Peter/Jacqui
- Bantjies controls trust that will receive R18.685M+
- Bantjies can ensure all money goes to his creditors (Peter/Jacqui)
- Victim beneficiary (Jacqui) receives nothing despite being entitled to ~R9.34M
