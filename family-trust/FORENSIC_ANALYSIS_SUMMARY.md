## KEY EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. THE QUADRUPLE CONFLICT EXPOSED

**Timeline of Premeditated Corruption**:
- **June 2025**: Bantjies receives murder/fraud evidence from Daniel  
- **July 2024**: Bantjies appointed as Family Trustee *(PREMEDITATED POSITIONING)*
- **August 2025**: Bantjies acts as Commissioner of Oaths for fraud documents  
- **August 2025**: Bantjies gives false supporting affidavit *(PERJURY)*
- **September 2025**: Trust used to force settlement  
- **May 2026**: R18.685M payout controlled by Bantjies as Trustee  

### 2. FINANCIAL MOTIVE - R18.685 MILLION INVESTMENT OPTION

The evidence proves Bantjies positioned himself as trustee specifically to control the **R18.685 million (option) investment payout** scheduled as follows:

| Date | Amount | Jacqui's Share (~50%) |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **May 2026** | R18,685,000 | ~R9,342,500 |
| **May 2027** | R23,165,000 | ~R11,582,500 |  
| **May 2029** | R28,730,000 | ~R14,365,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **R18,685,000 (option price)** | **~R9,342,500** |
