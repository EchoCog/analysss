- **Pattern**: Financial distress in days leading to mass transfer
- **Evidence**: Account insufficient funds for basic business operations
- **Timing**: Systematic decline immediately before major transfers

### Business Impact on Creditors:
- **Sharp Steel & Hardware**: Business supplier unable to receive payment
- **TLC Nailbar**: Rent obligations unable to be met

3. **Authorization Trail**: Who had access to these accounts on this date
4. **Receiving Accounts**: Trace destination of R 8.55M transfers

### Key Prosecution Points:
1. **Coordinated Timing**: All transfers within 6-minute window proves premeditation

4. **Personal Benefit**: Business funds transferred to personal savings accounts

## üîí DEFENSE COUNTER-ARGUMENTS & RESPONSES

### Likely Defense: "Legitimate Business Transfer"
**Prosecution Response**: 
- No business justification for R 8.55M simultaneous transfer
- All accounts left with insufficient operational funds
- Transfers to personal savings, not business operations
- Coordinated timing indicates premeditation, not business need

### Likely Defense: "Authorization Existed"
**Prosecution Response**:
- Banking records will show who made these transfers
- Fiduciary duty requires business purpose for such transfers
- No business resolution or documentation for R 8.55M movement
- Result (business destruction) proves lack of legitimate authorization

## üìã EVIDENCE FILING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Urgent Asset Preservation Order**: Freeze receiving accounts immediately
2. **Anton Piller Order**: Preserve digital banking records and devices
3. **Mareva Injunction**: Prevent dissipation of traced assets
